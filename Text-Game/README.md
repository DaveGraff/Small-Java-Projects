Operation

This is a turn based game. Every time you submit a valid move, the board is updated to reflect the changing environment. Monsters move every second turn, and spawn every fifth. Monsters will always attempt to close the distance with a player as efficiently as possible.

Controls
--------
Move: **W**, **A**, **S**, **D**

Shoot: **Space**

You may only perform one of these actions each turn. Upon selecting one, the turn will end and the board will refresh.
